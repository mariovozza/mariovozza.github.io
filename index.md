## 🎨 Theme & Style

To make the page look more modern with a **grey background and light green accents**, create a file called `_config.yml` in the root of your GitHub Pages repository and set a Jekyll theme (for example **Cayman**).  

Example configuration:

```yaml
title: "My Homepage"
theme: jekyll-theme-cayman

# Custom colours
style: |
  body {
    background-colour: #2e2e2e; /* Dark grey */
    colour: #e0e0e0;           /* Light text */
  }
  a {
    colour: #7CFC00;           /* Light green */
  }
  a:hover {
    colour: #adff2f;
  }
