# 👋 Hello, I'm Mario Vozza
## **Currently: Visiting Ph.D. Student at Durham University, Durham, UK**.

Welcome to my personal **GitHub Pages** homepage.  
I am a passionate and independent thinker with a strong drive for solving problems through creative, out-of-the-box approaches.  
My experience spans diverse domains, from **safety-critical coding and automation** to the exciting fields of **reinforcement learning and artificial intelligence**.  

I have collaborated with a wide range of partners and excel at managing both **high-risk, short-term challenges** and **long-term, project-driven initiatives**.  
Thriving under pressure, I remain committed to delivering consistent, reliable results.  
This way your intro feels like a personal yet professional elevator pitch.

## 🚀 What I Do
During my academic journey, I have mainly worked on projects focused on the integration of **artificial intelligence with materials science**.  
My primary research interest lies in the field of **Scientific Machine Learning**, particularly in addressing complex physical problems through AI models such as **Physics-Informed Neural Networks, Graph Neural Networks, and Neural Operators**.  

Another area that greatly fascinates me is **Reinforcement Learning**.  
I have collaborated on several projects across both academia and industry, tackling **NP-hard problems** such as the **Travelling Salesman Problem** using **Graph Pointer Networks** within an **Actor–Critic framework**.  
In particular, I worked with real-world data derived from **digital twins of the cities of Bologna and Modena**, extracted through the **SUMO traffic simulator**.  

I am always open to new challenges and fields of exploration.  
One of the key lessons I have learnt during my doctoral path is that in the realm of **applied AI**, the fusion of diverse backgrounds often makes the difference between a good model and an excellent one — capable of being not only accurate, but also efficient when deployed in real-world environments.

## 📂 My Projects

Here are some of my main repositories:

- [Torch-PDE](https://github.com/mariovozza/TorchPDE.git)  
  Torch-PDE is a repository aimed at collecting implementations of partial differential equations (PDEs) rewritten in PyTorch. The long-term goal is to build a library of efficient, GPU-accelerated      solvers that can be used both for scientific simulations and for generating datasets in Scientific Machine Learning (SciML).

➡️ You can explore all my repositories on [GitHub](https://github.com/mariovozza).
